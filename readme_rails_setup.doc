Step one / Configure your Route:
1. go into the config folder, then the routes.rb file

2. Writing the code to create the route:
  get '/literal url extension' => 'controller class name # method name'
  ex: get '/name' => 'name#method'

  1. the get means load

  2. within the single quotes, type in the literal name of what extension you want in the url.

  3. after the hash rocket, within single quotes, put in the name of your controller class, then a hash tag, then the name of the method belonging to the class


Step two / create your controller
1. go into the controller folder (which is inside the app folder) and create a "controller_name.rb" file

2. in that file, initialize your controller class ex: "class NameController". The Name will be exactly the same as the Controller class name in your route.
and the "Controller" refers to that fact that is it a controller class.

3. Make this class inherit from ApplicationController
ex: class NameController < ApplicationController

4. Create a method within this class which will have the same name as the method in the route.
ex: class NameController < ApplicationController
      def method
      end
    end

Step three / create your view
1. Go into the views (which is inside your app folder)

2. Create a folder with a same name as your controller class
ex: app -> views -> name

3. Within the folder create separate files for each method belonging to that class, these files should be saved as .html.erb files.
ex: app -> views -> name -> method.html.erb

This file is wrapped into the pre-existing code from app -> views -> layouts -> application.html.erb
We can write our html code in this file.
